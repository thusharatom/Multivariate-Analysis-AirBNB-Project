# Multivariate-Analysis-AirBNB-Project
This project was done as a part of my Multivariate Analysis subject. The aim was to predict the number of first destination booking of new users. The code here only consists of the profiling and modeling for the destination, Australia.

Equations are created for each of the 12 destinations separately, and each new user is scored against it and classified.

Tools used : SAS and Excel

Statistical Technique : Logistic Regression
